```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## Instructions
Create a web page presentation using R Markdown that features a plot created with Plotly.

Host your webpage on either GitHub Pages, RPubs, or NeoCities.

Your webpage must contain the date that you created the document, and it must contain a plot created with Plotly. We would love to see you show off your creativity! 

## Assignment:

```{r eval=TRUE, include=TRUE}

## Loading plotly library
library(plotly)

plain_x <- c(1:100)
plain_y <- rnorm(100, mean = 0)

# Creating a data frame
data <- data.frame(plain_x, plain_y)

# Plotting a scatter graph using plotly
plot_ly(data, x = ~plain_x, y = ~plain_y , type = 'scatter', mode = 'lines')
```
