```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```
## Background
Create a web page using R Markdown that features a map created with Leaflet. 

Host your webpage on either GitHub Pages, RPubs, or NeoCities.

Your webpage must contain the date that you created the document, and it must contain a map created with Leaflet. We would love to see you show off your creativity! 

## Assignment:

```{r eval=TRUE, include=TRUE}
library(leaflet)

new_icon <- awesomeIcons(
  icon = 'ios-close',
  iconColor = 'black',
  library = 'ion',
  markerColor = "red"
)

content <- paste(sep = "<br/>",
  "<b>Starbucks</b>",
  "Half Day Road",
  "Vernon Hills, IL"
)

my_map <- leaflet() %>% addTiles()

my_map <- addMarkers(my_map, lat=42.20326790430256, lng=-87.93517151955625, popup = "Starbucks Coffee", icon= new_icon)

my_map
```
